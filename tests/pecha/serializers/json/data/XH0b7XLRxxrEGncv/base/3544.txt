In the valley an old bridge arched over the slow river
A person traveler or pilgrim paused at the railing and listened
Birds called from the alders
Leaves fell like small coins
He remembered a proverb
A bridge crossed is a fear halved
The name carved on the stone L Tenzin some letters are illegible
At dusk the lanterns were lit along the path to the monastery
A child chased a stray dog and slipped
An elder caught the child
The elder said
Do not cling to that which is passing
Variant readings
Some manuscripts give do not cling to life
Some do not cling to things
A marginal note explains the proverb and cites an old refrain
One witness copy stops here
Another continues with a second stanza
