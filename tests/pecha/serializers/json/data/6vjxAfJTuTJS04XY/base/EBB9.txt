The Heart of the Blessed Lady Perfection of Wisdom
In the Sanskrit language: Bhagavatī Prajñāpāramitā Hṛdaya
In the Tibetan language: The Heart of the Blessed Lady Perfection of Wisdom
This is the first volume.
I prostrate to the Blessed Mother, the Perfection of Wisdom.
Thus have I heard at one time.
The Blessed One was dwelling at Vulture Peak Mountain in Rājagṛha together with a great assembly of monks and a great assembly of bodhisattvas.
At that time, the Blessed One entered into the meditative absorption of the Dharma discourse called 'Profound Illumination.'
At that time, the noble Bodhisattva Mahasattva Avalokiteshvara was contemplating the practice of the profound perfection of wisdom.
Also view those five aggregates as empty of inherent nature.
Then, through the power of the Buddha, the venerable Śāriputra addressed the noble great bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara with these words.
Translation of the Tibetan Buddhist Text<br><br>'Noble son, whoever wishes to practice the profound perfection of wisdom, how should they train?' Upon this being asked, the noble Bodhisattva Mahasattva Avalokiteshvara spoke these words to the venerable Shariputra: 'O Shariputra, any son or daughter of noble family who wishes to practice the profound perfection of wisdom should view things in this way: they should correctly and completely observe the five aggregates as empty of inherent nature.'
Form is emptiness. Emptiness is form.
Form is not other than emptiness, and emptiness is not other than form.
Similarly, feelings, perceptions, mental formations, and consciousnesses are empty.
Therefore, Shariputra, all phenomena are emptiness—without characteristics, unborn, unceasing, without defilement, without freedom from defilement, without decrease, and without increase.<br><br>Therefore, Shariputra, in emptiness there is no form, no feeling, no perception, no mental formations, no consciousness; no eye, no ear, no nose, no tongue, no body, no mind; no form, no sound, no smell, no taste, no touch, no phenomena.
There is no eye element, and there is nothing from the absence of the mind element up to and including the absence of the dharma element and the mental consciousness element.
There is no ignorance, nor is there any cessation of ignorance, up through there is no aging and death, and no cessation of aging and death. There is no suffering, no origin, no cessation, and no path. There is no wisdom, no attainment, and also no non-attainment.
Therefore, Shariputra, because bodhisattvas have nothing to attain, they rely on and abide in the perfection of wisdom, free from mental obscurations.
Since there are no obscurations in the mind, there is no fear. Having completely transcended misconceptions, one reaches the culmination of nirvana.
All the buddhas who abide throughout the three times have attained manifest, perfect, complete enlightenment by relying on the perfection of wisdom. <br><br>OR <br><br>All the buddhas who dwell throughout the past, present, and future have fully and completely awakened to unsurpassable, perfect, complete enlightenment by depending on the perfection of wisdom.
Therefore, one should know the prajñāpāramitā mantra, the mantra of great awareness, the unsurpassed mantra, the mantra equal to the unequaled, the mantra that thoroughly pacifies all suffering. Because it is not false, it should be known as true.
Thus: Gone, gone, gone beyond, gone completely beyond, enlightenment, so be it!
Thus, Śāriputra, a bodhisattva, a great being, should train in the profound perfection of wisdom.
Then the Blessed One arose from that samādhi and bestowed praise upon the noble Avalokiteśvara, the Bodhisattva Mahāsattva, saying: 'Excellent, excellent! Son of noble family, it is exactly so.'
So it is, noble son. One should practice the profound perfection of wisdom exactly as you have taught.<br><br>This is indeed the case, son of good family. One should engage in the practice of the profound perfection of wisdom precisely as you have explained.
After the Blessed One had spoken these words.
The Venerable Shariputra <span class=\text-quotation-style\>Son of Sharadwati</span>, the Bodhisattva Mahasattva Noble Avalokiteshvara, and the entire assembly—including gods, humans, asuras, and gandharvas—rejoiced and praised what the Blessed One had spoken.
Thus concludes the Noble Heart of the Perfection of Wisdom.
