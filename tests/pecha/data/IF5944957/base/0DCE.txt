It is taught that there is no grasping and so forth.
It is said that it becomes a matter for analysis by reasoning, such as 'how could it be by the wind' and so on.
What is merely conventional is not ultimately existent; that is to say, it is examined as a mere designation, not as a real entity.
It is said, 'If it lacks external meaning, it is because, prior to conceptual thought, there is no real referent from the perspective of knowing.'
Thus, the statement 'Think about it' refers to a cognition in a dream that is without meaning, yet is something to be contemplated.
'What is that then?' is said to be just something to reflect on.
'Whenever' and so forth are said in order to explain that, even in dreams, in Madhyamaka there is no mind, and thus the dream example is invalid.
Therefore, it is taught: 'At that time, you do not have the example,' in order to demonstrate this point.
If during the waking state, one remembers and accepts that in the dream state there is clear awareness, then in terms of personal experience, one must also accept the appearance of an objectâ€”otherwise, if awareness is present but the object is not accepted, then it is not truly clear awareness.
