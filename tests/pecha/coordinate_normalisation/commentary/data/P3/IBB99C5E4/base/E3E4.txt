A Luminous Commentary on the Path to Liberation: Elucidating the Profound Meaning of Vajra Chedya (Cutting with the Vajra)

Homage to Mañjuśrī, the Glorious One of Gentle Voice! Exalted in the realm of the Dharma Body, free from all obscurations, adorned by the brilliance of the profound roar of emptiness, flowing ceaselessly like rain to nurture the minds of disciples, you are the supreme master of subjugation, holding the waters of power. To you, the steadfast wheel-turner, the conquering hero, who skillfully answers profound inquiries with clarity and reveals the supreme teaching free from afflictions, I bow in veneration. This text, renowned as The Vajra Cutter, is a commentary on the Perfection of Wisdom in Three Hundred Verses. It primarily expounds the meaning of selflessness and illustrates its essence extensively. Though a Chinese commentary exists, the absence of a Tibetan explanation makes it challenging to interpret

Explanation of the Title and Its Meaning

The Āryavajracchedikā-prajñāpāramitā-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra, or The Perfection of Wisdom that Cuts Like a Diamond, is a revered Buddhist scripture that teaches profound wisdom capable of cutting through ignorance, much like a diamond cuts through anything. It belongs to the Mahāyāna tradition, emphasizing the path of compassion and insight. The text begins with homage to all Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, honoring their enlightened wisdom and selfless guidance. It serves as a guide for practitioners seeking ultimate truth and liberation.

The passage describes the Buddha residing in Śrāvastī at Jeta Grove, a park offered by the generous follower Anāthapiṇḍada, surrounded by a large gathering of 1,250 monks and numerous bodhisattvas. It highlights the solemn setting and the significance of the audience present to receive the teaching.

The Blessed One begins his day by preparing for alms: The Buddha, following the monastic practice, dressed in his robes, took his alms bowl, and went into the city of Śrāvastī to collect food, demonstrating simplicity and reliance on the generosity of lay followers.

The Blessed One completes his meal: After gathering alms and eating the meal he received, the Buddha finishes the act of eating, symbolizing mindfulness and gratitude for sustenance.

The Blessed One prepares for meditation: After his meal, the Buddha sets aside his bowl and robe, washes his feet, arranges his seat, and sits cross-legged with a straight posture, focusing his attention in front of him, preparing for deep meditative practice.

The monks approach the Blessed One: Recognizing an opportunity to learn, many monks come to the Buddha, seeking his guidance and teachings, reflecting their devotion and eagerness for spiritual instruction.

The monks show reverence to the Buddha: Upon approaching the Buddha, the monks express deep respect by prostrating before him, circumambulating (walking around) him three times as a sign of reverence, and then sitting to one side, ready to listen and learn.

Subhūti is present in the assembly: Among the gathered monks, Subhūti, a revered disciple of the Buddha, is also present, indicating his importance in the gathering and readiness to engage in the teaching.
