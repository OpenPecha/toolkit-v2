The Heart of the Perfection of Wisdom, the Blessed Mother
In the language of India: Bhagavatī prajñāpāramitā hṛdaya
In the language of Tibet: Homage to the Perfection of Wisdom, the Blessed Mother!
In a single segment.
Thus did I hear at one time.
The Blessed One was residing on Vulture Peak Mountain at Rājagṛha together with a great saṅgha of monks and a great saṅgha of bodhisattvas.
At that time the Blessed One rested in an absorption on the categories of phenomena called illumination of the profound.
At the same time, the bodhisattva great being, noble Avalokiteśvara, while practicing the profound perfection of wisdom, looked and saw that the five aggregates are also empty of an intrinsic nature.
Then, due to the Buddha’s power, venerable Śāriputra asked the bodhisattva great being, noble Avalokiteśvara,
“How should sons of noble family or daughters of noble family train if they wish to engage in the practice of the profound perfection of wisdom?”
