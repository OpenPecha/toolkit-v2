The Heart of the Perfection of Wisdom of the Blessed Mother.
In Sanskrit: Bhagavatī Prajñāpāramitā Hṛdaya.
In Tibetan: The Heart of the Perfection of Wisdom of the Blessed Mother.
Thus have I heard at one time.
At one time, I heard these words.
The Blessed One was dwelling at Vulture Peak Mountain in Rājagṛha, 
together with a great assembly of monks and a great assembly of bodhisattvas.
At that time, the Blessed One entered the meditative absorption on the teaching called “Profound Illumination.”
At that time also, the bodhisattva-mahāsattva noble Avalokiteśvara looked upon the practice of the profound perfection of wisdom.
He saw that the five aggregates are empty of inherent existence.
Then, through the power of the Buddha, the venerable Śāriputra spoke these words to the bodhisattva-mahāsattva noble Avalokiteśvara
How should any son of noble family train who wishes to practice the profound perfection of wisdom?
