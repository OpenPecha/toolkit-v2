A Guide To The Bodhisattava's Way of Life Homage to all Buddha's and Bodhisattvas Respectfully I prostrate myself to the Sugatas Who are endowed with the Dharmakaya, As well as to their Noble Children And to all who are worthy of veneration.
Here I shall explain how to engage in the vows of the Buddha's Children, The meaning of which I have condensed in accordance with the scriptures.
Thete is nothing hete that has not been explained before And I have no skill in the art of thetotic; Therefore, lacking any intention to benefit others, I write this in order to acquaint it to my mind.
For due to acquaintance with what is wholesome, The force of my faith may for a short while increase because of these.
If, however, these are seen by others Equal in fortune to myself, it may be meaningful.
