# Background 

This toolkit is dedicated to storing and managing Tibetan Buddhist texts, their
translations, and essential annotations. The platform ensures efficient data retrieval, catering to
both educational purposes and AI model training. By preserving and organizing these sacred texts,
we aim to facilitate deeper learning and research, promoting a broader understanding of Tibetan
Buddhist teachings.



### Annotations 
In our context, annotations are metadata that provide additional information about the text. Annotations can be of various types, such as: Segment Annotations, Page Annotations, Line Annotations, and more. Annotations are stored in a separate file from the text, allowing for easy access and modification.

### Pecha
A Pecha is a traditional Tibetan book format that consists of loose-leaf pages stacked between two wooden boards and wrapped in cloth. The Pecha format is used to store and read Tibetan Buddhist texts. In our context, a Pecha is a collection of texts and their annotations.

### Alignment 
Alignment is the process of matching the text of a translation with the original text. This process is essential for creating parallel texts, which are used for translation and language learning. The matching can be done for translation, commnetary, or any other type of text mapping.
